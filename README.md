# simple-site-starter

Super simple website starter template with no frameworks

Purpose for this is for me(or anyone who stumbles upon this) to have a easy starting point when working on smaller projects where frameworks and bundlers are not neccesary

Has some basic css normalizer and setup for theming based on system preference

Also uses a simple service worker to cache content so it is available offline

## Features

- Pure CSS theming based on system/browser color preference
- Caches assets for offline mode with a service worker

# Development

For VSCode - Live Server
